Regardless, the result accomplishes an appealing look that manages a feel akin to an angel of war. The particles seal the deal and even if they aren’t impressive they work well to cohesively finish the theme; especially the halo present during Massacre.

The particles for Blood Thirst and Blood Price are rather similar and those used for Blades of Torment seem fragile. Additionally, his voice-over, processed and all, feels somewhat out of place with respect to his artificial life. Ultimately, Mecha Aatrox is a good skin that doesn’t really grab one’s attention until Massacre is on, and then lets down again. It could be said that when Mecha Aatrox works it really does but most of the time it’s only alright.

The gargoyle-like appearance stands out as Aatrox’s physiognomy could very well evoke the shapes of certain sea creatures. That makes the lack of proper boots rather reasonable as his body may be as adept at moving underwater as over it; it’s a deviation from the splash art but a welcome one.\r\nHis clothing is also fitting for a seafaring adventurer as he would use what he finds. The classic base is recognizable but always painted with a nautical shade. That would include his most prized and necessary possession: an impressive sword. The mix of fish spine and boarding sabre gives the blade a fantastic yet familiar look that is also very eloquent about its lethality. There aren’t any other additions but as a re-model the skin is pleasing enough.\r\nAll things considered, Sea Hunter Aatrox is a satisfactory skin with an appealing fantastic style that uses a pirate theme with, perhaps, a touch of an underwater feel.

The particle work is nice for the most part but here lies the inconsistencies. The flame incorporated to the orb is a good way of keeping its classic colours while Fox-Fire and Spirit Rush receive nice fire particles. However, the auto-attack particles seem uninspired as there’s little reason to keep them anchored to the classic style. Moreover, the dark blue trail left by Orb of Deception and the pink particles of Charm are simply incompatible with the fire palette. It’s understandable for the orb to keep its colours so as not to compromise readability. Nonetheless, this particular mix of classic and fire colours makes the skin seem unfinished or badly executed.

That’s because of the colour palette: the clothes and tail practically share the same hue and mesh with each other which makes Ahri look monochromatic. Additionally, her shoes have a rough shape that is visible even at a distance. Fortunately, the new particles and dancing animations further the theme; though, it’s strange that only her recall has a song added.

It succeeds to a point but it never really feels like the style is anything more than superficial. There’s a new outfit and particles but besides that it’s the same classic Ahri we all know.\r\nThe outfit has an appealing aesthetic incorporating Ahri’s fox features into the outfit. The curved, soft lines make it look advanced and modern as well as practical and relatively protective. Not all is well though, the outfit looks good yet it appears like a futuristic pilot’s uniform more than a super-heroine costume. On top of that, the exposed cleavage seems stamped on the outfit instead of being a natural part of it. Ahri is a seductive fox-girl but there are other ways of conveying that. Her re-coloured tails are complete and utter disappointment: the look is dull and uninteresting which opposes the stylish outfit.\r\nThe particles seem eye-catching with noticeable dark hues yet they actually don’t feel that different to the classic ones. Besides, for some reason, Charm remains untouched; which is puzzling after Popstar Ahri. The recall doesn’t impress either. Instead of being a dashing preparation for a teleport, typical of the genre, it seems like she’s calmly practicing some dance moves.\r\nIn the end, a bit like Foxfire, Challenger Ahri gives the impression of a skin that has an interesting concept behind it that wasn’t completely developed. The changes offered are good, overall, but they are unable to fully capture the Super Sentai style; or even that of a sci-fi pilot. For what it is, it’s a fine skin with nice looks and a distinct as well as appealing aesthetic.

Yet, at the very least, it makes the visuals stand out with a pencil style that suits the theme in a clever way.\r\nIn the end, it’s far from a surprising skin, on the contrary, but the specific quality of the textures lends it a different air that lets it stand out. Thus, Academy Ahri is a fine schoolgirl skin that presents its subject in a unique way.', 1, 100, 750, 0, 0, 5, '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/81B3RwLkYjM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 0),

The pixellated orb is evocative and the colour-transitions of the tails are a formidable addition. However, the tails themselves are quite simple and seem borrowed straight from Classic. The clothes aren’t that surprising either. They are casual with some whimsical asymmetry but don’t say much. The headphones with ears are a great way of recreating her fox-nature with additional gear. The disappearing tails when she dies further the idea that she’s a human gamer with a liking for cosplaying; all suitable and appealing. It’s not very clear why there are tails and why they disappear but the general message works.\r\nThe new pixellated particles and chip-tune sounds are nothing groundbreaking but certainly effective. Every ability looks familiar but well translated into an 8-bit style. The sounds don’t impress but support the visuals without issue. The visual designs can end up being a bit too traditional and similar to the usual shapes used for such powers. Besides, the sounds have a tendency to mesh with each other and sound all alike. Regardless, the theme is eloquently presented. The new recall is an evident but welcome addition that explains the nature of the skin while also being a great representation of the skin’s concept.\r\nWhen all is added together we find that Arcade Ahri is a good skin but that only shows brief glimpses of brilliance. The adaptation is, for the most part, adequate and only the new colours for the tails feel unique. That’s not to say that the pixels and chip-tunes lose their charm but they are nothing new by now. The clothing is also unremarkable, headphones aside, so the feel of more of the same appears after a while. For that reason, Arcade Ahri is a fine addition for fans of the Nine-Tailed Fox despite leaving the feeling that more could’ve been achieved.', 1, 100, 1350, 1, 1, 0, '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFTjpMKfYQQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 0),

The attack animation used for most actions like auto-attacks, Orb of Deception, Fox-Fire and Charm seems to be variations of the same one: one arm forward and one knee bent. There are minor changes to fit each action but the general stance is the same. Sometimes she jumps like in Fox-Fire or she steps forward in auto-attacks or lean foward in Orb of Deception and Charm. Spirit Rush does see her flying partially enveloped in her tails and spreading stars with both arms in a wide arc. The ultimate manages to have its personality even if it isn’t impactful. Then there’s the shy standing idle pose and the demure walking animation which are good fits for her personality as exposed in the new voice-over. The new death animation is surprisingly tragic and dramatic with Ahri being mortally wounded and saying goodbye to her familiar before disintigrating, while Kiko tries to jump towards her before that. Given the otherwise lighthearted approach and mood of the skin it seems like an unexpected turn of Puella Magi Madoka without warning. Emotes show her playful personality and the recall futher exposes that with a clear display of star magic which has not little in common with her ultimate. In all aspects they are fitting animations that do what is expected of them.\r\nAll added together, we must say that Star Guardian Ahri is a charming skin. At a glance, it seems like just another magical girl tribute that adopts the recognisable sailor-styled uniform and adds a saccarine dose of stars and twinkles to the point of being cloy. However, the skin is much more effective than what it initially appears to be. Doses are well measured and balanced so as to define a decidedly familiar but also appealing personality that ends up being attractive. There’s no doubt that while the skin is visually dazzling it’s nothing impactful: it’s all been seen before. That doesn’t detract from the stable and cohesive implementation which makes for a skin that not only suits Ahri but integrates her into the magical girl fantasy with surprising ease.

The new model tries to convey the Predator style but the scant armour isn’t as eloquent as the new kamas in conveying the idea. In fact, her outfit appears to be more revealing than Predator-styled with only brief suggestions of the meshes and bones that would decorate it over multi-layered plates.

The recall is a mixed affair: initially it’s all show with a pointless demonstration of how to unite her kamas; something she never applies. By the end of the recall as she fades into invisibility the skin manages to capture a bit of the expected Predator feel.\r\nAll in all, Headhunter Akali is an uneven skin with a model that doesn’t communicate its message clearly.

The shoes are sensibly comfortable and simple which suits both of Akali’s roles.\r\nThe knife is evidently exaggerated but the style of the skin is one to encourage such a choice.

The penguin travellers through the Magical Journey corridors are another example of what the skin can achieve. The rest of the particles rely on snowflake patterns and chilly sounds and while suitable they seem to lack the ingenious approach of the meeps and shrines. The recall is an exception as it shows the friendly relationship between Bard and his meeps and that is palpable in their personality.\r\nThe general feel of the skin is attractive and fills the Snowodown bill well. However, it does feel uneven. In areas, it’s the usual suspects: winter clothes and snow particles. In others, it’s imagination and charm as the cocoa shrines, penguin meeps and Magical Journey demonstrate. It’s not that the snow looks bad, on the contrary, but it pales in comparison with the inventiveness showed elsewhere. Even the new ice skating animation seems subtle in comparison. Additionally, the inspiring magical feel of Classic Bard seems toned down and only resurfaces in specific touches.\r\nUltimately, Snow Day Bard is a good skin but it can feel uneven. It has some wonderful additions and others that despite being good fail to make an impression. The problem is that while the skin adapts Bard in full to a Snow Day the price seems to be set because of the champion’s complexity more than the extra steps that the skin takes. At 1350 RP a skin needs to do more not do what can be done and justify the expense in how vast the landscape was. Therefore, Snow Day Bard is a charming skin but also expensive so a sale is recommended.', 1, 97, 975, 1, 1, 0, '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4V5303d0tTw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 0),

The strict adherence to the classic design also restricts the appeal of the particles. Without exaggerating, most abilities look like their classic counterparts but with less granular pixels. Fortunately, there are exceptions that add some personality to the abilities. Auto-attacks are just an array of pixels flung at the enemy. Although different from flames they aren’t innovative. Blaze displays stacks as little flames at the top of the burning enemy and also adds a soft and appealing glow as well as some flying pixels; the stack counter seems useful. Sadly, the explosion as stacks accumulate is just pixels following the classic flame template. Something similar happens with Sear as it’s just a pixel fireball.

However, the one skin that goes all out for sex appeal has her wearing low heeled boots. The skirt is practically a re-texture of her classic skin and though passable it simply doesn’t match the chosen police style; just like the tall hat. Even her top doesn’t further the police concept with a badge, instead preferring a tie. On the whole, the skin does deliver the general idea but it doesn’t execute it well; even to the point of detracting from it. In conclusion, Officer Caitlyn is a thorough disappointment that only offers a neat looking rifle as its single saving grace. Unless the rifle wins you over, or you have a thing for underdressed figures of authority, better avoid this skin.', 1, 100, 750, 0, 0, 0, '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8SB-YXpcEY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 0),

(98, 'cai', 'Caitlyn Nguyệt Hồn', 'images/caitlyn-nguyethon.jpg', '	Visually, Lunar Wraith Caitlyn is an attractive and pleasing skin. With a distinct style that is both elegant as well as oneiric she easily stands apart from the usual sniper look. The dress is elaborate and classy and her rifle takes both aspects a step further. Of course, such attention to form leaves several doubts about how plausible and practical it is to go about shooting with such gear. However, if the skin sets itself only to provide an interesting appearance it is effective at it. It isn’t very believable but manages to compensate with an unusual aspect that stays close to the fantastic.\r\nThat’s also part of the skin’s problem. Caitlyn looks like an extravagant lady with a strange taste and, with a pinch of imagination, she appears unreal like escaped from a dream. Nevertheless, there’s little evidence of her wraith nature in the skin and she also lacks the vibrancy displayed in the splash art. There’s only a large blue eye on the rifle and the strange shape of her right arm, which could be a peculiar sleeve from the look of things, to present her supernatural life. These elements don’t really convey the feel of a spirit; less so anything snake related. Instead, it seems like a strange ornamentation or a dream-like woman with some weird aspects. That is emphasised by the decorative aesthetic that, far from being wraithlike, looks colourful and fantastic.\r\nThe particles and sounds follow the same trend. They do appear different but the blue design and soft sounds don’t feel like coming from a wraith. It all seems magical but lacks the impact expected from a spirit. Perhaps it’s a matter of what kind of image a wraith brings to the mind. In that case, Caitlyn remains closer to the extravagant but classy lady with magic powers more than a spirit. Her recall aims at stating the wraith theme with more clarity but, again, can seem more dreamlike than wraithlike.\r\nAll things said and done, Lunar Wraith Caitlyn is an appealing skin that may not evoke the expected image and sound of a wraith but that presents an attractive oneiric aesthetic; at best. The price is rather hefty for a re-model with new particles, sounds and recall, though. While attractive there’s nothing here that doesn’t fit at 975 RP. Add to this unclear focus of her appearance plus diluted theme and we are left with a skin that can be quite interesting but that doesn’t present its personal allure as it should.', 3, 59, 1350, 1, 1, 0, '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qZM4VJH6y0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 0),
(99, 'cai', 'Caitlyn Vũ Khí Tối Thượng', 'images/caitlyn-vktt.jpg', 'Pulsefire Caitlyn is more than a simple sci-fi version of the Sheriff. The idea is to transport her law enforcement through the ages and, essentially, turn her into a time cop; most obvious thanks to her new voice-over. In that regard, there’s much that is appealing in the skin but the new model, sadly, isn’t the best exponent. The futuristic armour, for all the elaborate intensity displayed in the splash art, appears dull and simple. There’s only a shadow of the design shown in two dimensions. On top of that, her stylistic choices are more obvious. The leather jacket and boots, even if futuristically stylish, can feel out of place. However, they don’t join a hat as a testament of Caitlyn’s distinct personality. Why the hat was omitted when jacket and boots are, practically, decoration is difficult to understand. The fact that hat assets are present and that togglable or switchable hats could make the skin more interesting feels like a wasted opportunity. At least, her nice blue hair is easily visible.\r\nThe rifle doesn’t suffer from such problems. The basic version, without levelling Ace in the Hole, offers a lean barrel backed by a powerful engine. The elaborate, almost prototype-like, design speaks of cutting edge technology. When Ace in the Hole becomes a possibility the changes aren’t as large in scope as they could be but they are effective. With barrel reinforced by, perhaps, additional generators the rifle seems more responsive to abilities and looks like a finished and powerful piece of weaponry.\r\nParticles, much like sounds, follow a specific design that ends up being quite attractive even if there is a clear, rigid blueprint that both follow. While particles employ bright and colourful splashes of sprinkling energy the sounds reflect such fluid behaviour with muffled whiplashes for shots and more digitally, high-pitched tones for abilities with more of a technological display. What stands out the most is the various indicators and HUD elements added to the abilities: Headshots, Yordle Snap Traps and, without a doubt, Ace in the Hole. It’s also interesting how the grid effects are used when items appear like traps, also when they snap, and the rifle transformation at the beginning of the ultimate.\r\nWhile everything tends to be strict in the direction it goes there’s consistency that makes the message clear. This is further supported by emotes which make use of the rifle in various ways; a versatile piece of equipment indeed. It’s even better because the development of the Pulsefire personality doesn’t stop there. When running at high speed the rifle makes for a swiftly ready floating bike. The recall also takes advantage of the rifle by opening a portal which Caitlyn makes use for her travels through time and space. The joke on hats adds little to the skin given that they are irrelevant in the larger scheme of things. The death isn’t as clear, though. Instead of the rifle opening a portal for Caitlyn to flee or suffering a malfunction she simply vanishes in thin air. It’s a good effect but such independence from the rifle comes out of nowhere; after all, she even leaves it behind.\r\nConversely, the rest of animations aren’t particularly different from the classic ones. Specifically, auto-attacks and abilities don’t show Caitlyn acting any different from her usual self. Fortunately, the rifle steps in for a much needed dose of personality on the auto-attacks as well as Piltover Peacemaker and, most prominently, in Ace in the Hole. This reminds not just a tiny bit of Headhunter Caitlyn. In a way, Pulsefire feels like a brighter take on the same futuristic sniper but as a cop instead of a hunter. The good thing is that the skin manages to define its unique features rather well.', 5, 60, 2000, 1, 1, 0, '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/saPkzIKxXNI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 0),

While it’s true that Camille is classically an interesting and unique champion Program has the wisdom of stressing her synthetic enhancements turning her almost into a machine. The artificial legs are no longer her most prominent feature, her entire body is modified and even her face, otherwise clearly visible, is hidden behind an expressionless visor of many functions. The fantastic ribbon cables on her back are the obvious way to interface with other compatible machines. The chest glows with the power source presumably responsible for keeping her functions and her legs also adopt holographic displays. This astounding model is a great base to start the skin which, sadly, isn’t followed in the best of ways by the rest of the additions.\r\nThe main problem with the changes to the abilities is that particles are too brief and sounds familiar. The former employ triangular bases and circuit designs to communicate the theme. While the polygonal shields of Adaptive Defenses stand out those used for auto-attacks, Tactical Sweep’s impact and Hookshot’s cables are too brief and simple. The circuit trails used for Precision Protocol and Tactical Sweep are much more attractive but they are so briefly visible that their complexity is difficult to appreciate. The mark on the ground used by Hookshot is simple and also similar to classic. Fortunately, The Hextech Ultimatum takes all that is good about the classic version and enhances it with circuit-like beams and a triangular mesh which nicely takes advantage of the skin’s futuristic concept. While more could be achieved, its sober design is effective and appealing without being overloaded with bells and whistles.\r\nThe sounds have a virtual energy feel that is always suitable but seldom stands out. The vibrating sound of Adaptive Defenses manages to be different like the booming flow of energy of The Hextech Ultimatum. The other abilities have sounds that feel more virtual in comparison to the classic ones yet also strike as familiar.

The armour is more interesting and also could be too complex for its own good. The headgear is majestic, fitting for a Queen, the cleavage-generous cuirass is stylish following the golden decorations of the headgear. The multiple plates that protect the tail have a symmetric design that reminds of other Eternum skins, Nocturne and Rek’Sai.

The particles for the jets and guns also add to that appeal striking a good balance between old and new.\r\nThe new glowing pixel particles are very well done. They are evidently pixellated but also display complex designs that result in elaborate effects. Granted, some effects are simpler than others yet no ability looks simplistic; even though they don’t reach the spectacularity of other skins. It’s also true that Missile Barrage could’ve been more impressive. It looks good but doesn’t have the punch expected of an ultimate. The chip-tunes are a great support for the visuals. They embrace the low-fi nature proper of the theme while staying attractive. There aren’t any that are of particular note yet they manage to round the skin well. The recall is a clear and effective homage while the new animations for the busters when attacking and the barrel rolls when flying add much welcome diversity to the usual actions and cement the skin’s identity.\r\nAll things considered, Arcade Corki is a fantastic skin that brings out all the pixel-fuelled nostalgia it intends with a fitting layer of modernism over it.

Besides, as the basketball is ever present it’s arguable whether the backboard or the ball is his real weapon; which cements the theme but appears ambiguous.\r\nThere are some rough edges: the particles for Hemorrhage and Noxian Guillotine are the only ones that really stand out. On top of that, Noxian Guillotine is so fast that its new look is barely noticeable; which is a letdown. Besides, the sounds tend not to seem particularly special.

Fur and hair look like cotton but the clothes are visually appealing. The mask is a believable echo of an oni with the usual design but evocative enough.

The other abilities are stricter in following the classic layouts yet they manage to add some attractive polygonal patters that effectively deliver the expected virtual feel. It’s also worth noting that Chronobreak’s hologram distorts its image, from time to time, with horizontal lines which is a subtle effect that breathes life into the execution.\r\nThe sounds complement well the abilities’ visuals. Their soft, artificial, almost crystalline bursts offer a distinct aural landscape that further cements the theme. Individually, none stand out from the rest.

As a matter of fact, the visual upgrade reduced the amount and length of the particles as well as the variety of design. There’re less grids and specific shapes for each ability and trails are notoriously brief unlike how particles were before. Now, each ability looks like the same ball of energy with, sometimes, extra decoration around it. It’s frankly surprising and unexplainable how an upgrade can end up having the opposite effect.\r\nThe animations are definitely a highlight especially at the latter levels when Ezreal can fly with his jetpack. The abilities’ animations range from good to great.

The new controller glove and pointless rucksack seem to be the only, even disconnected, console references which, ultimately, aren’t as attractive as they initially appear.

Duelist’s Dance vitals indicator has a florid design fitting of her style though they could also fit Classic with a different colour. Triggering the passive spreads a few yellow petals in the air, very similar to Classic, that remind of feathers; like those seen in Championship Ashe. That same effect is seen behind Fiora when she employs Lunge. There’s also a blue glow around her that makes the ability a bit more interesting but there’s nothing remarkable. The petals appear again for Riposte, drawn to her as the recall swords appear over her to end in a single thrust. Bladework’s first hit employs a subtle blue glow for the blade and a downward swirl for the impact which is rather appealing. The second hit reuses the glow but in yellow with a simple spark for the hit which lets down. Grand Challenge shows a bit of style taken from every other ability. Familiar Duelist’s Dance indicators surround the target and flow outwards with fluid, blue energy while a few petals swirl around. When hitting all four vitals they explode in more petals, subtle but elegant, and leave a large diagram on the ground that initially shows a bit of the blue energy and then glows with vertical, golden energy. The effect is quite nice in both cases but quite shy too. The diagram is eye-catching but doesn’t feel connected to Fiora. Her clothes don’t display any similar pattern so that it’s a missed opportunity that her cape, at least, doesn’t echo such a design.\r\nSounds are simple but appealing relying on bell chimes of different pitches. Duelist’s Dance is a string of high pitched chimes and Lunge even higher pitched. Riposte offers sliding metal and hits with high-pitched chimes. As a representation of blade mastery it communicates the idea well and it’s a sound that stands out. Bladework’s initial low-pitched bell chime is rather nice and familiar in its Eastern feel. The hits that ensue are a similar, weaker chime for the first hit and a disappointing chime for the next. Grand Challenge, again, joins abilities’ characteristics. There’s an initial bell chime like in Bladework half-way mixed with Riposte’s sliding metal but shorter and a tad higher pitched; still low. There’re weak chimes that die out as time goes by until the vitals are hit and there’s a flute tone to indicate that the true magic starts.

The same can be said about Chum the Waters with its fleeing carrot and gigantic rabbit; also present in the circling animation.

The visor is the maw from where a couple of big eyes stare at prospective enemies. The suit isn’t as colourful but follows suit with a tricolour style that is attractive despite its simplicity. It merely covers Fizz’s unique physiognomy but also respects its characteristics; like having pads for the tips of his fingers and toes. The bicolour gloves and boots complement the bicolour design of the suit so that they are connected yet have their own style. The back also sports a beacon that will be useful to call assistance and the harpoon looks advanced yet it’s a recognisable weapon.\r\nThe particles are vivid and colourful. In spite of the approach being minimalistic and brief there’s a distinct feel. Trails and explosions made up of several streams of colour and rings that superimpose like waves supplement the base colour scheme while also further defining the Super Galaxy identity. The ultimate relies on a certain beacon carried on Fizz’s back. It’s the device responsible for signalling where Chomper has to surface with an attractive display of colours. The sounds mix twinkling, splashes and playful tones to incorporate several elements of the skin’s identity into a whole. They are measured yet distinct and never overload an ability.\r\nSpecial mention deserves the delightful recall. Not only is it a fitting exit for Fizz but also a quintessential part of what defines the skin’s personality. Short of merely referencing the theme it expands on it by showing in a suitable action an essential part of being a costumed hero: your vehicle. It may start with a needless show of aerobics on Fizz’s part but the final part is simply wonderful. Overall, it’s an example of what a recall should be.\r\nAll in all, Super Galaxy Fizz is an accomplished skin that without modifying the core nature, after all he’s simply wearing a fancy outfit, permeates his activities with the necessary dose of heroism. The theme is realised without groundbreaking but always effective and appealing additions. Individually, the features are good but together they are more than the sum. It still needs to bedazzle the eyes with eye-catching displays to be excellent and the Super Sentai feel could be more deeply integrated.

It also makes his eyes small glowing circles which still blink in a subtler way to his classic large eyes. The trident gets serrated blades, an electricity emitting centre and a propeller in the opposite end. Overall, it’s a good model but with few characteristics that catch the eye. Chomper becomes a large bottlenose dolphin with sharp teeth, perhaps too sharp and with shark tendencies even, some evidently water-resistant camouflage paint and some scars.

Auto-attacks show sparks on hit and Seastone Trident’s passive adds fittingly appealing streaks of electricity on enemies. The dark water bubbling out of them is less understandable and interesting. The indicator with an exclamation mark inside a triangle that shows affected enemies is animated elegantly and subtly. Seastone Trident’s active displays an appealing movement of horizontal lines, electricity on the trident’s blades and energy coming out of the trident’s other end. It’s all somewhat measured but certainly appealing. The empowered attack also shows an energy blast and leaves horizontal lines running up and down on the enemy. Playful has him glowing rather nicely on his trident. Trickster becomes a large splash of dark water with a glowing hemisphere around it which makes some sense but not too much with regards to the spread of fluid. Chum the Waters has Fizz throw a swimming mechanical fish with a light on its dorsal fin; which circles enemies or struggles on the ground.

Nevertheless, neither idea is given much weight in the execution. It’s Galio as a soldier without much attention given to the interpretation. The adaptation, though, is effective in its fanciful way.

The model with its regal golden-lined armour, floating wings and familiar yet effective devil body conveys the demon lord idea with some originality. There’s no doubt that Colossal Smash also adds to the distinct personality with its subtle highlights on the wing’s panes and flames on the vambraces. When such particles aren’t about the skin turns off a bit but the flame burning firm between the horns states that not all power has been snuffed yet.\r\nSadly, the rest of the abilities don’t echo the great work of the passive.

They incorporate spectral maws and flames but always in a subdued way that neither deviates much from Classic’s design nor really fits such an eye-catching demon lord. Their sounds only receive minor scraping tones added to the Classic base; perhaps to add some additional horror. The animations convey a more defiant personality that is suitable but still largely based on the classic one. The use of dark silhouettes with glowing eyes for Justice’s Punch and Hero’s Entrance is a good touch that adds to the skin’s theme.\r\nThere are a few extra touches like the high-speed flight animation, shared with Shield of Durand, the new death and recall. They all help further the demon lord identity though there’s only so much that they can do; being secondary activities to the main set of attacks. Much is based on Classic and for a legendary skin in this day and age it’s no longer acceptable. Even the new voice-over is succinct and brief without adding additional quotes beyond the basic ones.\r\nAll added together, Gatekeeper Galio is a skin with an attractive concept and a barebones execution. It does all the changes it has but with the feel that the shortest path was chosen whenever possible.

The printed cloth on the back may seem out of the ordinary but for the aristocratic inclinations of the Debonair Colossus it seems fitting enough. The wings gem-like surface aims at framing and decorating more than being a serviceable means of transport. The silvery glow of wings and cufflinks given by Colossal Smash makes the elegance even more notorious even if the lack of shoes seems like a questionable concession.\r\nExcept for the passive, abilities keep the golden classic look. If the skin incorporated more gold than just the wings’s guard, cuffs and cravat gem then they would suit better. As it stands, there’s too much blue and white which doesn’t mesh with the gold well enough.\r\nThere’s also the fact that his scornful face seems fitting for a villain yet there’s no suggestion of such malevolence.

As if that wasn’t enough, the armour’s design is quite close to the classic one and the colours look drab so it doesn’t have much of a distinct personality.

However, we are talking of a clearly fictionalized approach to the appearance to the point that he looks like a character taken from a cartoon. The gigantic boarding sabre is another step into exaggeration but at the very least it looks quite good. What doesn’t help at all is the enormous spaulders on his shoulders. In spite of the shark head it’s an evident attempt to conform to the classic design. Perhaps it would’ve been better to have them as large epaulettes so that a middle ground between the classic look and sea theme could’ve been reached. As they stand, huge pieces of plate armour make little sense and further move the skin into the ridiculous.\r\nAll things considered, Rogue Admiral Garen is a fancy cartoon villain with a penchant for overdoing things.

Sadly, it’s a feel that is restricted by the rigid design and lack of elaboration on the many aspects that make up the skin.

It appears as if the skin ignores the context where it’s actually used. In addition to his, while Mini Gnar is cute, as he should, Mega Gnar is a bit of a mixed bag. The dinosaur looks like a cartoony monster which could be fitting but fails to impress. Maybe part of the problem is that the concept seems forcefully adapted. It’s made to work but doesn’t do anything new: instead of having a furry boy become a furry monster we have a reptilian appearance in use.

It should be noted that the cuteness extends from the Mini to the Mega Gnar, as the recall manages to demonstrate, but the dual nature isn’t compromised.\r\nFurther additions are only a few new particles and sounds that poke fun at the theme without detracting from the base concept.

The fact that he wields a small ice axe only serves to reinforce the civility. Mega Gnar seems simpler in comparison keeping the same bestial aspect but with a bluish, polar coat of paint. The cap and scarf aim at adding some more of the theme and the appeal of Mini Gnar but it seems like too little.\r\nThe particles are, for the most part, essentially a re-colour of the classic ones.

The fact that it also behaves as a boomerang further pushes the already improbable supposition.\r\nThe tiny champion belt becomes a much larger one when Mega Gnar appears. At large, the outfit remains unchanged except for the fact that it conforms to a much bulkier and fitting wrestler physique. The mask turns into makeup over the plainly Leónine features. The burly lion is the most significant facet of the transformation and makes the suggestion a reality; which is a good choice, though Mini Gnar is already furry enough. The new boulder to toss makes a bit more sense than the pipe. However, it clearly chooses a modern, perhaps too contemporary, piece of rubble.\r\nWhen all is joined together, the luchador theme isn’t as effectively delivered as could be expected.

From the triangluar glasses to the pointy lapels the intention is clear. The design doesn’t directly echo any character from Gurren Lagann but stays within the expected confines of anime. There’s a quasi-metallic suit underneath a jacket and a laser gun being dragged. This is where Gnar’s feral personality starts to clash with the expected ingenuity of a mecha pilot. While his size makes Mini Gnar a potentially believable pilot of Mega Gnar his behaviour is simply too erratic. It could be said that it matches the rage-fuelled attacks of the mecha but those are supposed to be part of the mecha’s design not of the pilot’s irrational mind.\r\nThat said, Mega Gnar is a very convincing and drill-decorated mecha; more from Gurren Lagann. The hulking physique is imposing and being heavily armoured on the front makes the mecha design interesting as it has a focus. The jet on the back seems to serve no purpose as it isn’t used in-game; Crunch could’ve been a good opportunity for that. Regardless, the multiple layers of plates that make up the body of the mecha create an appealing even if stylised robot.\r\nParticles tend to be rather shy with small, brief effects that even if fittingly holographic also seem weak. Probably out of need, Rage Gene has a distinct glow thanks to the sparkles and circles; though the red ones clash with the blue ones. Still, the blue glow is an effect that stands out. When transforming between Mini and Mega Gnar the horizontal distortion has a nice hologram feel; that reminds a bit of PROJECT but stands apart enough. Throwing a gun for attacks stands halfway between concession to the classic design and display of wilderness. This actually stresses the dichotomy instead of collaborating in bridging the gap. The circles that indicate Hyper’s bonus damage are a nice even if unexpectedly measured touch. Boulder Toss is interesting due to throwing a drill; the new projectile in this skin and more Gurren Lagann. GNAR!, as an ultimate, benefits from some interesting visuals as the clawing of land and subtly grid-covered circle show.
